tinyavi (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use by default -vf-clr and -af-clr to avoid any influence from user
    config files.
  * Use -frames 500 with -ss 0, 150, 300, 600 as suggested, instead of
    -endpos 10:0. This is both faster and more reliable.
  * Perform the deinterlacing as the very first filter. Some filters
    may change the image and kerndeint, if inserted after them, can not
    detect interlaced video.
  * Denoise filter by default without parameters.
  * Added the "sharpen" option, which enables -vf unsharp=l:3x3:1
  * Added the volume normalization option, on by default
  * Interface improved to include new options
  * Added a "Remove" button to remove videos from queue
  * Use the -nouse-filedir-conf switch for mplayer to avoid .conf files
    to influence mplayer test run.
