tinyavi (0.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the "HD" (High-Definition video, 1920x1080) and "HDR" (High-Definition Ready,
    1280x720) targets. This can be used to convert Blue-Ray disk images to smaller
    video files, and even overbloated HD video files to smaller ones. Unfortunately,
    mencoder's lavf (including Matroska) container format is currently broken, so
    for now tavi will output AVI files. Use mkvtools to convert the resulting AVI
    to the Matroska (mkv) format, if you wish.
  * New profiles for teXet T-8X0 media players and for NeXX NF-910.
  * More descriptive target names and short aliases for using with command-line
    (e.g. "Cowon D2" (CD2), "Nokia N8x0 (MPlayer engine - best)" (N8X0MP) and so on).
  * New command-line option "-T" to show a descriptive list of supported targets.
  * Even simpler user interface! The "Convert All" and "Stop All" buttons
    are gone; instead, you can now select/unselect all files by clicking
    the right mouse button in the list.
  * In simple GUI mode show a "output directory" entry field so that user may put
    the resulting file in a different directory. If output directory is unset (empty)
    or is the same as the original file, an "-tiny" suffix is appended to resulting
    file name. Otherwise, the original file name is used (because the directory is
    different).
  * RealMedia video files (.rmvb) will be shown in the 'add file' dialog box.
  * Encoding now is being done at idle priority. This makes the encoding
    process virtually unnoticeable for your normal activity.
  * Many smaller enhancements and bugfixes

tinyavi (0.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * In non-advanced mode the output filename mask is not shown.
    Instead, the output filename is displayed during the conversion process.
  * Implemented simple drag'n'drop support. Now you can throw files
    from your desktop at TinyAVI.
  * The window can be now minimized.
  * Implemented support for URIs (e.g. filenames like
    file:///var/ftp/%C3%C5%F3.avi will work now).
  * If the config file is broken (or in a very old format), the program
    won't crash now, but just ignore the broken config.
  * Now .flv files will be displayed in the file open dialog on GNOME 2.20.
  * The "All files" filter in the open dialog was not working.
  * More fixes regarding filename encodings

tinyavi (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed -af-clr because there's no such option in mencoder.
  * Implemented the "Advanced" mode for geeks. All non-advanced stuff
    is hidden in default mode now, which makes the program very simple
    and easy to use. To enable, add "Advanced=True" to the "TinyAVI"
    section in ~/.config/tinyavi-gui.conf
  * Advanced mode: added two entry fields where you can enter the values
    for the -V and -A options (additional audio and video filters).
  * Added the notion of "Max width / height" to the profiles. This is the
    max physical resolution of the device screen. This is used to make
    the video a bit larger than suggested width/height if it uses the
    same number of pixels (e.g. W*H) like the suggested size.
  * Added the "Extension" field to presets. This sets the default extension
    (the value of the %(ext)s macro) for the output file.
  * Redone the Nokia N8x0 presets to more sane values. There are two
    presets now: for the GStreamer engine and for the MPlayer engine.
    The later outperforms GStreamer by a factor of ~1.5 speaking of resolution
    and bitrate.
  * Added autodetection for number of CPUs.
  * Added short selectors for every preset, for usage with the -t switch
    of tavi.
  * If mencoder returns non-zero exit status, do so in tavi.
  * Use yadif instead of kerndeint, which is alot better.

tinyavi (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use by default -vf-clr and -af-clr to avoid any influence from user
    config files.
  * Use -frames 500 with -ss 0, 150, 300, 600 as suggested, instead of
    -endpos 10:0. This is both faster and more reliable.
  * Perform the deinterlacing as the very first filter. Some filters
    may change the image and kerndeint, if inserted after them, can not
    detect interlaced video.
  * Denoise filter by default without parameters.
  * Added the "sharpen" option, which enables -vf unsharp=l:3x3:1
  * Added the volume normalization option, on by default
  * Interface improved to include new options
  * Added a "Remove" button to remove videos from queue
  * Use the -nouse-filedir-conf switch for mplayer to avoid .conf files
    to influence mplayer test run.

tinyavi (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Redone config file via ConfigParser, now using a regular
    ini-style file format.
  * Implemented encoding presets.
  * Added presets for Nokia N8xx, Aero Vision photo frame, Cowon D2,
    untested presets for Sony PSP and iPOD.
  * Implemented a Quality parameter (0-2) which allows to balance
    between file size and video/audio quality.
  * Packaged for Debian/Ubuntu
