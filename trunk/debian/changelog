tinyavi (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed -af-clr because there's no such option in mencoder.
  * Implemented the "Advanced" mode for geeks. All non-advanced stuff
    is hidden in default mode now, which makes the program very simple
    and easy to use. To enable, add "Advanced=True" to the "TinyAVI"
    section in ~/.config/tinyavi-gui.conf
  * Advanced mode: added two entry fields where you can enter the values
    for the -V and -A options (additional audio and video filters).
  * Added the notion of "Max width / height" to the profiles. This is the
    max physical resolution of the device screen. This is used to make
    the video a bit larger than suggested width/height if it uses the
    same number of pixels (e.g. W*H) like the suggested size.
  * Added the "Extension" field to presets. This sets the default extension
    (the value of the %(ext)s macro) for the output file.
  * Redone the Nokia N8x0 presets to more sane values. There are two
    presets now: for the GStreamer engine and for the MPlayer engine.
    The later outperforms GStreamer by a factor of ~1.5 speaking of resolution
    and bitrate.
  * Added autodetection for number of CPUs.
  * Added short selectors for every preset, for usage with the -t switch
    of tavi.
  * If mencoder returns non-zero exit status, do so in tavi.
  * Use yadif instead of kerndeint, which is alot better.

tinyavi (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use by default -vf-clr and -af-clr to avoid any influence from user
    config files.
  * Use -frames 500 with -ss 0, 150, 300, 600 as suggested, instead of
    -endpos 10:0. This is both faster and more reliable.
  * Perform the deinterlacing as the very first filter. Some filters
    may change the image and kerndeint, if inserted after them, can not
    detect interlaced video.
  * Denoise filter by default without parameters.
  * Added the "sharpen" option, which enables -vf unsharp=l:3x3:1
  * Added the volume normalization option, on by default
  * Interface improved to include new options
  * Added a "Remove" button to remove videos from queue
  * Use the -nouse-filedir-conf switch for mplayer to avoid .conf files
    to influence mplayer test run.
