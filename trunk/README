These are two simple tools for converting video files to a format suitable
for miscellaneous pocket video players. I tried to find the least common
denominator for a number of devices I owned, I hope the output format
will work on your pocket device as well. If it doesn't and you know why,
you can drop me a note, and perhaps I will include support for your device
in later versions of TinyAVI.

There are two programs: one is a command-line converter, and second is a
graphical interface to the command-line converter. I hope the usage of
the command-line tool is obvious from it's built-in help.

The conversion heavily relies on the mplayer/mencoder programs, so you
must have them installed if you want to do anything useful with TinyAVI.
Also, the GUI program requires PyGTK, so install it if you want a graphical
interface to the tool.

To install the program, just execute (as root):

        make install
