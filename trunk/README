These are two simple tools for converting video files to a format suitable
for miscellaneous pocket video players. There are some pre-created presets,
they actually may work for devices other than listed. If no preset works for
you, you can drop me a note with the name of your device and the options
for mencoder, and I'll add them into the next release.

There are two programs: one is a command-line converter, and second is a
graphical interface to the command-line converter. I hope the usage of
the command-line tool is obvious from it's built-in help.

The conversion heavily relies on the mplayer/mencoder programs, so you
must have them installed if you want to do anything useful with TinyAVI.
A fresh version is recommended, as mplayer/mencoder sometimes changes the
format of the command line and of the output, so if mplayer fails for some
obscure reason, check first if you're using the latest version.

Also, the GUI program requires PyGTK, so install it if you want a graphical
interface to the tool.

To install the program, just execute (as root):

        make install
